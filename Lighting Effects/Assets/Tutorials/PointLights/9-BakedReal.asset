        m_Untranslated: 'In the Inspector window for a light GameObject, you''ll
          see a Mode property. There are three types of modes for lights. Depending
          on a gamer''s hardware available and how you want devices to process your
          lighting effects, you may choose one mode over another. Let''s quickly
          break down the three types.


          Baked - Useful for light effects
          that won''t change during gameplay, like scenery and directional light.
          Baked light calculations are processed when a game project is saved or
          exported from Unity. This reduces shading and lighting processing during
          gameplay.


          Realtime - Useful for lighting and casting shadows
          on dynamic GameObjects or moveable elements. Lighting effects are processed
          in realtime during gameplay. This can take time or cause issues if the
          gamer''s hardward isn''t strong enough to handle the processing in complex
          scenes.


          Mixed - This mode divides the processing between baked
          and realtime. It''s useful for baking scenery-impacted environments and
          some dynamic GameObjects.


          Throughout the remainder of this
          lesson''s tutorials, you may choose between baked or realtime modes for
          your lights. Since the scenes you''ll be working with aren''t complex,
          it''s recommended that you use Realtime mode on all lights except for Directional
          lights.


          However, if you find that your computer has difficulty
          processing the lights in Play mode while testing your projects, change
          all of your lights to Baked mode.'

        m_Untranslated: '1. Make sure the Directional Light in the Hierarchy window
          is selected.


          2. In the Inspector window, change Mode to Realtime
          if your computer is able to handle the processing power needed during Play
          mode.


          3. Test out the light processing in Play mode by selecting
          the play button. If it takes too long to process or load, try changing
          your light back to Baked mode and test Play mode again.


          When
          you''ve decided which light mode works best on your machine, select the
          Next button to continue.'
